			<h1>About the Greater Manchester Skeptics Society</h1>
			<p>
				The Greater Manchester Skeptics run the Manchester Skeptics in the Pub events, which are held twice each month. A bunch of Mancunian skeptics get together in the pub to discuss science&nbsp;&mdash; sometimes with a guest speaker, sometimes without but always with plenty of alcohol!
			</p><p>
				You don't have to be a member to come to our events, everyone and anyone is welcome. If you're in Manchester, come along!
			</p><p>
				<strong>Speaker</strong>: We'll have a guest speaker over on the second Thursday of each month. This is usually held at 8PM at TV21 in the Northern Quarter.
			</p><p>
				<strong>Social</strong>: On the fourth Thursday of each month we'll generally meet at 7PM in the The Church Inn, 84 Cambridge Street, Hulme, M15 6BP.
